This is a simple and interactive math quiz website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz generates random multiplication problems, and the user's score increases by one point for each correct answer. The quiz provides instant feedback, making it an engaging tool for practicing multiplication skills.

Features:
Random Multiplication Problems: Generates two random numbers for each question.
Instant Feedback: Notifies users immediately if their answer is correct or incorrect.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of the user's score, increasing with each correct answer.
This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development and my ability to create interactive web applications.
